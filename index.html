    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <P><b>She/her | 25 | Chicago</b>
    <br>I was born in Chicago but raised in South Carolina. I moved back
    to Chicago when I was 19 after dropping out of college. I worked at Macy's for
    a while until I left fall of 2021. <br><br> When I started at Target 
    I learned about their Guild program & enrolled in a full stack
    bootcamp. Prior to that I had minimal experience with HTML & CSS 
    thanks to tumblr. I loved to play with the code in the themes
    & learned the basics of HTML & CSS there. It was always an interest 
    so when Target offered the opportunity to learn, I just couldn't say 
    no!</P>
